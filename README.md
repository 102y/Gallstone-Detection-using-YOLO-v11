# Lung-Cancer-Image-Analysis-using-YOLO-v11-Instance-Segmentation
This project aims to develop an advanced YOLO v11-Instance-Segmentation model to detect and localize lung cancer tumors or abnormalities in chest X-ray images, based on pre-labeled data provided by Roboflow. The model is trained using the LungCancer dataset, which includes annotated images of lung tumors with precise segmentations for each tumor instance.

Overview:
Model Used: YOLO v11-Instance-Segmentation
Dataset: The "LungCancer" dataset from Roboflow, containing chest X-ray images with detailed tumor and nodule segmentations.
Project Goals:
Improve detection and segmentation accuracy for lung cancer regions.
Develop an AI-driven system for automatic detection and segmentation, enhancing its use in research and medical applications.
Training Details:
Number of Epochs: 10
Image Size: 640 Ã— 640
Device: CPU
Steps:
Load and train the model using the train() function.
Test the model on new images to validate its accuracy in detecting and segmenting cancer locations.
Results and Future Prospects:
This model can serve as an assistive tool for analyzing X-ray images in cases requiring fast and precise tumor detection and segmentation. It has potential applications in lung cancer research and supports quick, accurate medical diagnoses.
